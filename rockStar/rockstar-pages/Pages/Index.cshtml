    <i>[Chorus (2x):]</i><br>
    Last Christmas<br>
    I gave you my heart<br>
    But the very next day you gave it away.<br>
    This year<br>
    To save me from tears<br>
    I'll give it to someone special.<br>
    <br>
    Once bitten and twice shy<br>
    I keep my distance<br>
    But you still catch my eye.<br>
    Tell me, baby,<br>
    Do you recognize me?<br>
    Well,<br>
    It's been a year,<br>
    It doesn't surprise me<br>
    (Merry Christmas)<br>
    <br>
    I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
    With a note saying, &quot;I love you,&quot;<br>
    I meant it<br>
    Now I know what a fool I've been.<br>
    But if you kissed me now<br>
    I know you'd fool me again.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br>
    <br>
    Oh, oh, baby.<br>
    <br>
    A crowded room,<br>
    Friends with tired eyes.<br>
    I'm hiding from you<br>
    And your soul of ice.<br>
    My god I thought you were someone to rely on.<br>
    Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.<br>
    <br>
    A face on a lover with a fire in his heart.<br>
    A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo.<br>
    Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br>
    <br>
    A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
    A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
    Maybe next year I'll give it to someone<br>
    I'll give it to someone special.<br>
    <br>
    Special...<br>
    Someone...
